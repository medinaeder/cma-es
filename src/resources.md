Questions:

Is there a way to compute the eigenvalue of a rank_mu matrix without having to compute it explicitly
When are negative weights useful??

Covariance Matrix size limitations in numpy??
We should be fine in 2D but in 3D we have some problems

SOME BUGs:
    Getting Runtime Warnings due to overflow encountered in double scalars
    Major BUGS! ugh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
